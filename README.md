# ICESat-2 Surface Velocity

Scripts for estimating ice velocity from ICESat-2 data.

This project was started at the 2020 ICESat-2 hackweek. The idea is that repeat altimetry can be used to infer ice velocity by correlating the surface slopes between acquisitions. The idea is based on similar work with the ICESat-1 GLAS altimeter (Marsh and Rack, 2010).
