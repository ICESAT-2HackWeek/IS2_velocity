# ICESat-2 Surface Velocity

Surface ice velocity from repeat passes using the across slope between beams and the slope between points on the same track. Cross overs could also be used. Which product?, maybe ATL06 or ATL03. It should be interesting to compare different areas (e.g. Antarctica, Greenland, Patagonia). Surface ice velocity from laser altimetry  has been done with ICESat 1 over the Ross Ice Shelf. The smaller footprint could improve the accuracy and the precise repeat passes could account for seasonality over certain regions.

This project was started at the 2020 ICESat-2 hackweek. The idea is that repeat altimetry can be used to infer ice velocity by correlating the surface slopes between acquisitions. The idea is based on similar work with the ICESat-1 GLAS altimeter (Marsh and Rack, 2010).
